# Dashboard Restructuring Summary

## Overview
The dashboard.html file has been completely restructured according to modern web development best practices while preserving all existing functionality.

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Modular Architecture**
- **Separated concerns**: CSS, JavaScript, and HTML are now in separate files
- **Component-based structure**: Each major feature is now a separate module
- **Reusable components**: Notification system, file management, upload handling, etc.

### 2. **File Structure**
```
app/static/
├── css/
│   └── dashboard.css                    # All dashboard styles
├── js/
│   ├── dashboard.js                     # Main dashboard controller
│   ├── config/
│   │   └── dashboard-tailwind.config.js # Tailwind configuration
│   ├── components/
│   │   └── notification-manager.js     # Notification system
│   └── modules/
│       ├── dashboard-file-manager.js   # File display and management
│       ├── upload-manager.js           # File upload functionality
│       └── password-manager.js         # Password change modal
```

### 3. **Code Organization**
